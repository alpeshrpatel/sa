Everybody does it.\"\n\nWilliams then received another for a racquet smash at 3-2 in the second set, leading to Ramos docking her a point as Osaka started at 15-0 in the following game.\n\nThe American was furious, walking up to Ramos, shouting and pointing at him as the crowd started booing in support of the former world number one.\n\nThe drama continued as the atmosphere in Arthur Ashe Stadium became more toxic.\n\nWilliams refused to let the issue slide and launched an extraordinary rant at Ramos at the changeover, with Osaka leading 4-3.\n\n\"You are a liar. You will never be on a court of mine as long as you live. When are you going to give me my apology? Say you are sorry,\" she told the Portuguese.\n\nThat led to Ramos docking her the next game - leaving Osaka just one more away from victory at 5-3 up.\n\nBoos continued to rain down, generating incredible noise, as Williams refused to take to the court and demanded an intervention from the tournament referee.\n\nEventually she returned to the baseline, serving out a game to love before Osaka showed remarkable focus to hold the final game that sealed her first Grand Slam win.\n\nWilliams later accused the umpire of sexism, saying: \"He's never taken a game from a man because they said 'thief'.\"\n\nBoos, anger & tears\n\nNaomi Osaka was left hiding her tears at the presentation ceremony of her first Grand Slam trophy\n\nWilliams is a national icon in the United States, as well as a global star around the world, and had the backing of the 24,000-capacity Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nBut the boisterous crowd was quietened as Osaka came out firing at the six-time champion.\n\nOsaka, playing in her first Grand Slam final and against her idol, showed no fear as her aggressive approach led to multiple Williams errors.\n\nWilliams' first-serve percentage was down at 38% and made 13 unforced errors as Osaka broke for 2-1 and 4-1 leads on her way to the opening set.\n\nThe Ashe crowd, while remaining respectful towards Osaka, was already upset with the way Williams had been treated - and unhappiness turned to anger during the drama of the second set.\n\nSecurity staff ran on to the perimeter of the court as Ramos walked off and the Portuguese did not return, as he would usually have done, for the trophy presentation.\n\nMore boos followed at the start of the ceremony, leading to Osaka pulling her visor down over her eyes to hide her tears.\n\nWilliams appealed for calm in her runner-up speech, asking her supporters to \"give credit\" to Osaka's achievement.\n\nThe Japanese player composed herself as the crowd began to applaud her, although she almost dropped the trophy as she walked off the stage.\n\n\"It was always my dream to play Serena in the US Open finals so I am really glad I was able to do that,\" she said.\n\nThird time angry for Serena\n\n\"This has happened to me before, this is not fair,\" Williams told the umpire after she was docked the point for racquet-smashing, apparently referring to two previous controversies at US Open matches.\n\nThe American received a point penalty on match point of her 2009 semi-final against Kim Clijsters following a tirade at a line judge.\n\nThe Belgian was two points from victory when Williams, who had earlier been given a code violation for racquet abuse, was called for a foot fault.\n\nWilliams launched an angry outburst at the official and got the point penalty, meaning Clijsters won 6-4 7-5.\n\nShe later apologised.\n\nThat incident left Williams on a two-year probation period, so she was fined $2,000 (\u00a31,265) for abusing umpire Eva Asderaki during the 2011 final, where she lost to Australian Sam Stosur.\n\n\"If you ever see me down the hallway look the other way,\" she told Asderaki. \"You're out of control. You're a hater and you're just unattractive inside.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nBBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller\n\nIn recent years, Serena Williams has rightly been lauded for speaking out about discrimination faced by women and the black community. Her voice has become a very powerful one, but this latest US Open outburst does not reflect well on her.\n\nIncensed at being warned for coaching, as she felt her character was being called into question, she initially made her point forcefully - but politely - to Carlos Ramos. Many umpires might have turned a blind eye, as the rule is widely flouted, but Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou has admitted he was trying to send her a message.\n\nWhen Williams broke her racquet in anger, Ramos had no alternative. A warning is followed by a penalty point.\n\nThis is when the 36-year-old started to lose her cool. Jabbing her finger angrily in Ramos' direction, she called him a liar and a thief and suggested she would make sure he never umpired any of her matches again. Anything that questions an umpire's honesty has to be penalised and credit to Ramos for having the courage to make that call against the greatest player of all time as she chased history on home soil.\n\nThe presentation ceremony began in a poisonous atmosphere, until Williams took the initiative. She put her arm around Osaka, congratulated her and asked the crowd to stop booing.\n\n'Osaka had moment snatched away' - social media reaction from tennis world\n\nNaomi Osaka became the first Japanese to win a Grand Slam\n\nAmerican former world number four Brad Gilbert: This is so sad and especially for Osaka on her tremendous level throughout the tournament. The coaching violation was ridiculous - SW23 never saw it and looked liked absolutely nothing. Seen 50x worse and not called. Osaka was two games from the finish line, let the match play out.\n\nBritish number four Liam Broady: I think incredibly strong from the umpire to not be intimidated by a GOAT of the game and hand out the game penalty. You shouldn't talk to anybody in this way whether they're an umpire or person on the street.\n\nAbsolutely gutted for Osaka. Has had this moment snatched away from her, hardly smiling lifting the trophy.\n\nCanadian tennis player Vasek Pospisil: What a disappointing way for a US Open final to end.\n\nSerena Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou tweeted shortly after the end of the match\n\nSerbian former French Open champion Ana Ivanovic: What a performance by Osaka!! So strong and composed and what a champion Serena is!\n\nBritish former number one Greg Rusedski: A new star is born in the women's game! What a performance from Naomi Osaka. She stood toe to toe with Serena Williams. All the headlines unfortunately will be about the point, game penalty & chair umpire, but we should remember the extraordinary performance from Naomi Osaka.\n\nAmerican former US Open champion Andy Roddick: Worst refereeing I've ever seen...the worst!!!\n\nBritish former tennis player Andrew Castle: Serena Williams was fined $175,000 after the 2009 US Open semi-final meltdown v Clijsters. This will be hefty too. Not sure how any unbiased observer who knows the rules and history of tennis can look at what happened and defend Serena.\n\nAmerican 12-time Grand Slam singles champion Bille Jean King: When a woman is emotional, she's \"hysterical\" and she's penalised for it. When a man does the same, he's \"outspoken\" & and there are no repercussions. Thank you, @serenawilliams, for calling out this double standard.

The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation.\n\nThe SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a \"Swexit\" referendum. However, the powerful centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead.\n\nAside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires.\n\nDuring the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires and many farmers were forced to destroy livestock after their pasture land dried up.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Swedish teen's sit-in climate protest\n\nSupport for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country.\n\nThe Left party is making gains too, from the environmentally concerned and from centre-left voters dissatisfied with the mainstream parties' approach to migration.\n\nWho could be in charge?\n\nPrime Minister Lofven currently heads a minority, centre-left coalition government made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party.\n\nIn recent years there has been a fall in support for the Social Democrats and the largest traditional opposition party, the centre-right Moderates.\n\nHowever, polls suggest that the Social Democrats are narrowly ahead of other parties and may be in a position to lead another minority government.\n\nBoth the Social Democrats and the Moderates have said they will not enter a coalition with the SD, however well they perform."}]}, "theguardian": {"rss": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/09/mike-pence-denies-discussing-plan-to-remove-donald-trump-from-power", "published": "2018-09-09T02:40:39", "title": "Mike Pence denies discussing plan to remove Donald Trump from power", "text": "A bombshell newspaper essay which detailed efforts to sideline Donald Trump from government was \u201cjust an obvious attempt to distract attention from this booming economy and [the president\u2019s] record of success\u201d, vice-president Mike Pence has said.\n\nSpeaking to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation in an interview to be broadcast in full on Sunday, Pence also denied that White House officials had discussed invoking the 25th amendment and removing Trump from power.\n\nFear review: Bob Woodward's dragnet descends on Donald Trump Read more\n\nThe comment piece was published by the New York Times on Wednesday, under the title \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\u201d and attributed to a mystery \u201csenior official\u201d.\n\nIt came a day after the Washington Post detailed veteran journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s reporting in a new book that Trump aides regularly disobeyed orders or removed papers from the president\u2019s desk.\n\nThough the author of the New York Times article said there had been discussion of removing the \u201camoral \u2026 impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective\u201d Trump from power, he or she also drew attention to administration achievements \u2013 Republican goals including \u201ceffective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cadults in the room\u201d had achieved this while working around the president\u2019s \u201chalf-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless\u201d decisions, the author said.\n\nAmidst a torrent of criticism and official denials and a gleeful Washington whodunnit \u2013 and with suspicion falling on Pence himself, given the use of \u201clodestar\u201d, a word common in his public remarks \u2013 the vice-president told CBS he \u201cwouldn\u2019t know\u201d who wrote the piece.\n\n\u201cBut what I can say,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a disgrace.

They will also consider calls to keep open the option of a fresh referendum on any deal Theresa May may strike on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\nWill big three unions back members\u2019 call for a people\u2019s Brexit vote?

But he said that if Labour was unable to force one in the coming months, he wanted to \u201ckeep all options open\u201d, including supporting a new referendum.\n\nMcDonnell said he was sure there would be a full debate, and votes, on Brexit at the Labour conference. And he went out of his way to praise the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which he said had been very \u201cconstructive\u201d and had made clear that its attempts to influence Labour policy should not be seen \u201cas an attack on Jeremy Corbyn or positioning around the leadership. It should be a constructive debate and that is right.\u201d\n\nThe poll found that members of Unite, the country\u2019s biggest union, and Labour\u2019s largest financial backer, now support a referendum on the final Brexit deal by 59% to 33% and support staying in the EU by 61% to 35%. GMB\u2019s members support putting the issue back to the people by 56% to 33% and its members want the UK to stay in the EU by 55% to 37%.\n\nUnison members back another referendum by 66% to 22% and would opt to stay in the EU by 61% to 35%.\n\nUnion members think standards of living will deteriorate as a result of Brexit by a margin of around four to one (Unite members by 55% to 11%, Unison members by 61% to 16%, and GMB members by 49% to 11%).\n\nThey also believe Brexit will worsen, not improve, job opportunities (Unite members by 57% to 16%, Unison members by 52% to 27%, and GMB members by 43% to 18%).\n\nDespite claims that workers are overwhelmingly against immigration, members of all three unions want to prioritise trade over controlling immigration (Unison members by 68% to 22%, Unite members by 65% to 27%, and GMB members by 58% to 32%).\n\nLast week Tim Roache, the GMB\u2019s general secretary, announced that his union would back another referendum after consulting its 620,000 members. Roache, who will address a People\u2019s Vote March for the Many on the opening day of Labour\u2019s conference, said the country did not vote for a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit or to damage the economy.\n\n\u201cIn trade union terms, if we negotiate a pay deal for our members we put that deal back to the members and they decide whether that\u2019s acceptable or not.\u201d\n\nThe TUC is expected to adopt a new position on Brexit that will place an emphasis on jobs, rights at work and peace in Northern Ireland. Its executive council is also likely to back the possibility of another vote on Brexit.\n\nShakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, who will be speaking at the TUC, said: \u201cWhat this poll shows is that rank-and-file members of the three largest trade unions in the country are now united in solidarity with young people and students in backing a People\u2019s Vote on the final Brexit deal.\n\n\u201cThe campaign for a People\u2019s Vote is a movement that reaches out across regions, party, age, race and class. As we seem to be moving closer to a no-deal scenario which would be disastrous for the country, the time has come to join our voices for a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d\n\nWriting in today\u2019s Observer, Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov, said the poll could mark a turning point. \u201cIt\u2019s not that rank-and-file trade unionists are indulging in gesture politics or ideological breast-beating.\n\n\u2018They are worried about the impact of Brexit on jobs, taxes, living standards and the National Health Service. They fear that Brexit Britain would find it harder to sell products and services abroad.\u201d\n\nKellner says the methods used by YouGov are much the same as the company deployed when it correctly predicted Corbyn\u2019s win in the race for the Labour leadership in 2015.\n\nBaroness Margaret Prosser, a Labour peer and former president of the TUC, said: \u201cTrade unions always listen to members and that\u2019s why we\u2019re already beginning to see them move on this issue. But this poll is important because it shows we need to move further and faster in the next few weeks if we\u2019re going to fight for the best interests of workers.\n\n\u201cA People\u2019s Vote is the last, best hope we have of preventing massive damage on jobs, public services and our most hard-pressed communities.\u201d\n\nConservative MP and former minister Guto Bebb, who quit as a defence minister in July in protest at Theresa May\u2019s concessions to Tory Brexiters, yesterday added his voice to those backing another referendum."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/09/serena-williams-accuses-officials-of-sexism-and-vows-to-fight-for-women", "published": "2018-09-09T03:45:58", "title": "Serena Williams accuses officials of sexism and vows to 'fight for women'", "text": "After umpire row, the 23-time Grand Slam champion wins backing of tennis legend Billie Jean King after saying men are treated less harshly\n\nSerena Williams has accused an umpire of sexism and treating her more harshly than men as she used a press conference to double down on her earlier on-court tirade at the official during her US Open final defeat to Japan\u2019s Naomi Osaka.\n\nWilliams was cited by official Carlos Ramos for three code violations during her 6-2, 6-4 loss to the 20-year-old Osaka on Saturday: for getting coaching signals; for breaking her racket, which cost her a point; and for calling the chair umpire a thief, which cost her a game.\n\nSerena Williams rails at umpire as superb Naomi Osaka wins US Open Read more\n\nBut despite the match penalties, she renewed her attack at a media conference later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen other men call other umpires several things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m here fighting for women\u2019s rights and for women\u2019s equality and for all kinds of stuff.

During the US Open, a female player, Alize Cornet, was incorrectly admonished by a chair umpire for changing her shirt during a match, which is allowed and which men do all the time. And the US Tennis Association created a new rule last week that allows for a 10-minute break in men\u2019s matches when the heat and humidity are too harsh; previously, only women were given that chance for a delay.\n\n\u201cI just feel like the fact that I have to go through this is just an example for the next person that has emotions, and that want to express themselves, and want to be a strong woman.

But on Saturday, as Johnson took time out to watch the fifth test match between England and India at the Oval in London, where he was booed by the crowd, supporters said his career trajectory would be unaffected.\n\nBoris is a brand. He defies all logic. He can do things other politicians can\u2019t\n\nThe former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, who would have backed Johnson as leader in 2016 had he not stood down from the contest to succeed David Cameron, told the Observer: \u201cMost colleagues will be sympathetic and supportive at what is a difficult time for him. I very much doubt that this will have much impact on his leadership chances.\u201d Another friend of Johnson, who says the next party leader must be a hardline Brexiter, said: \u201cThere is a lot of sympathy. There is no reason why someone who has gone through a divorce cannot go on to be prime minister. And this probably applies to Boris more than anyone.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s next high-profile appearance is expected to be at the Tory party conference early next month, where he will address an event hosted by ConservativeHome, the website for grassroots party supporters. He is expected to use a speech to call again for May to drop the Chequers deal on Brexit \u2013 over which he resigned from the cabinet in July \u2013 and back a cleaner break from the EU.\n\nSources close to Johnson said this would be his only appearance at the Birmingham conference. The source said Johnson would be wary of making too brazen a pitch for May\u2019s job there, at a time when the prime minister would be trying desperately to hold the party together as she approaches the critical stages of the Brexit negotiations.\n\nPaul Goodman, a former MP and editor of ConservativeHome, said a hall with a capacity of 1,000 had been booked for the Johnson appearance. Goodman, whose organisation regularly polls party supporters for their views on who would be the best leader, said that he did not expect Johnson\u2019s personal problems to dent his chances in any contest. \u201cI think Boris\u2019s standing among party members is quite high and his standing among Tory MPs is quite low and I don\u2019t think this will make any difference.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson and Marina Wheeler announce divorce Read more\n\nA poll last week by ConservativeHome showed Johnson had the backing of 35% of Tory supporters to be the next leader, more than double the proportion backing any other candidate. A survey by Survation for the Daily Mail taken after news of his divorce was announced found 18% of voters felt his personal difficulties made him unfit to be prime minister, against 64% who thought it did not make him unsuitable.\n\nAnother senior Tory said that Johnson was different from other politicians, and could bounce back more quickly from difficulties than his colleagues. \u201cBoris is a brand. He defies all logic. He can do things that other politicians can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLater on Saturday, Johnson launched an uncompromising attack on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit strategy, likening Britain to \u201ca seven-stone weakling\u201d up against the EU\u2019s \u201c500lb gorilla\u201d.\n\nIn an article for the Mail on Sunday he continued: \u201cWe have wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution \u2013 and handed the detonator to Michel Barnier.\u201d"}]}, "breitbart": {"link": "http://www.breitbart.com/", "articles": [{"title": "Musk\u2019s Craziest Claims on the \u2018Joe Rogan Experience\u2019 Podcast", "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast Thursday where he made a number of outlandish claims and comments \u2014 here are some of the best.\n\nDuring the course of his interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made a number of outlandish claims while smoking weed and drinking whiskey with the host.

And under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the question was first, was this a substantial burden on the religious exercise? And it seemed to me quite clearly it was,\" Kavanaugh told lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"It was a technical matter of filling out a form in that case,\" he said. \"In that case, they said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objected to.\"\n\nPro-choice and anti-Kavanaugh groups seized on his reference to \"abortion-inducing drugs.\" Harris tweeted out the video, but cut out the preface that showed Kavanaugh making it clear he was summarizing the arguments of Priest for Life. The video therefore presented the reference as his own.\n\n\n\nHarris accused Kavanaugh of choosing his words carefully and said, \u201cThis is a dog whistle for going after birth control.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was nominated for the purpose of taking away a woman\u2019s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cMake no mistake - this is about punishing women.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood, in a press release, also left out the words \u201cthey said\u201d and later acknowledged the error, according to CNN.

The penalty was controversial, but the defeat thorough.\n\nThis U.S. Open final promised to be memorable. It certainly was.\n\nNaomi Osaka played brilliantly in the biggest match of her life, winning 6-2, 6-4 in her first Grand Slam final at age 20.\n\nFor so long, Osaka dreamed of playing her idol Williams in a major final. Not just playing, but winning. That became reality on Saturday, but not in a way should could have ever imagined.\n\nOsaka, who moved from Japan to Long Island with her family at age 3, denied Williams a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title (and first as a mom).\n\nShe became the first Japanese player to win a major. It shouldn\u2019t be her last. She did so fearlessly, showcasing the shot-making that put her into the final dropping just one set in six matches the last two weeks.\n\nMost notably, it came after Williams screamed at chair umpire Carlos Ramos after she was docked a point penalty for two code violations (illegal coaching from the stands and smashing her racket) in the second set.\n\nWilliams was then docked a game penalty for a third code violation, verbal abuse after calling Ramos \u201ca thief\u201d over the first violation. At the time she was down a break, 4-3, in the second set. The penalty made it 5-3 in favor of Osaka.\n\nWilliams won the next game on her serve to cut it to 5-4. Osaka then closed out the championship on her serve.\n\nThere was no scream. No drop to the court. No fist pump or racket toss. Osaka tugged at her visor and jaunted to the net.\n\nThe Pride of \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5!@Naomi_Osaka_ defeats Serena Williams 6-2, 6-4 to become the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam singles title!#USOpen pic.twitter.com/sNilrZOaNU \u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 8, 2018\n\n\u201cIt just still didn\u2019t really feel that real,\u201d said Osaka, who has admired Williams for so long that she did a third-grade report on her 12 years ago. \u201cSo for me it just felt like a normal match just walking up to the net. But it\u2019s Serena that\u2019s on the other side. She hugged me, and it was really awesome.\n\n\u201cWhen I step onto the court, I feel like a different person, right? I\u2019m not a Serena fan. I\u2019m just a tennis player playing another tennis player. But then when I hugged her at the net, I felt like a little kid again.\u201d\n\nWilliams received that first code violation when Ramos deemed that her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gave Williams illegal advice from her box at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nEarly in the second set, Mouratoglou appeared to make a hand gesture looking at Williams suggesting she move closer to the net during points. Williams denied she received the coaching, telling Ramos between points:\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve never done is cheat. If he gives me a thumbs up, he\u2019s telling me to come on. We don\u2019t have any code, and I know you don\u2019t know that. And I understand why you may have thought that was coaching, but I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t cheat to win. I\u2019d rather lose.\u201d\n\n\"I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose.\" \u2014Serena to the chair umpire after receiving a coaching violation pic.twitter.com/v6Q2GWYYOn \u2014 espnW (@espnW) September 8, 2018\n\nMouratoglou said after the match that he was coaching, but he didn\u2019t think Williams even saw it.\n\n\u201cI was [coaching], like 100 percent of the coaches on 100 percent of the matches,\u201d Mouratoglou said after the match on ESPN, adding that he had never before been called for a coaching violation. \u201cSo we have to stop this hypocrite thing. [Osaka\u2019s coach] Sascha [Bajin] was coaching every point, too. It\u2019s strange because this chair umpire was the chair umpire for most of the finals of Rafa [Nadal], and Toni [Nadal] is coaching every single point.\u201d\n\nLater in the second set, Williams received a second code violation for smashing her racket after being broken on serve. She approached Ramos\u2019 chair after she realized she had been, by rule, docked a point for two code violations.\n\n\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d she said, approaching Ramos. \u201cEvery time I play here, I have problems [Williams had memorable arguments with chair umpires in 2004 and 2011 U.S. Open losses, plus told a lineswoman she would stuff a tennis ball down her throat in a 2009 defeat.]. \u2026 I didn\u2019t get coaching. I didn\u2019t get coaching. I didn\u2019t get coaching. You need to make an announcement that I didn\u2019t get coaching. I don\u2019t cheat. I didn\u2019t get coaching. How can you say that? \u2026 You owe me an apology. You owe me an apology. I have never cheated in my life. I have a daughter, and I stand for what\u2019s right for her. I\u2019ve never cheated. You owe me an apology. You will never do another one of my matches.\u201d\n\n\"You owe me an apology!\" Serena was fired up with the official in the final set of the US Open final. pic.twitter.com/r6RSbrirnV \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 8, 2018\n\nAfter Osaka went up 4-3, Williams again spoke at Ramos from her chair, saying, \u201cYou stole a point from me. You\u2019re a thief, too.\u201d\n\nRamos gave Williams a third violation for verbal abuse, which constitutes a game penalty, putting her down 5-3 and on the brink of defeat.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Williams repeated. \u201cBecause I said you\u2019re a thief? Because you stole a point from me. But I\u2019m not a cheater. I told you to apologize to me.\u201d\n\nWilliams then asked for the tournament referee Brian Earley to come out. Earley and WTA supervisor Donna Kelso heard Williams out. She told them as the crowd booed:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not right. You know me. You know my character. And that\u2019s not right. This is not fair. This has happened to me too many times. This is not fair. This is not fair. To lose a game for saying that is not fair. \u2026 You know how many other men do things that are much worse than that? This is not fair. This is unbelievable. \u2026 There are men out here that do a lot worse, but because I\u2019m a woman, you\u2019re going to take this away from me? That is not right. I know you can\u2019t admit, but I know you know it\u2019s not right. I know you can\u2019t change it, but I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s not right. I get the rules, but I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not right. It happened to me at this tournament every single year that I play is just not fair. That\u2019s all I have to say. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nWilliams added in a post-match press conference: \u201cI\u2019m here fighting for women\u2019s rights and for women\u2019s equality and for all kinds of stuff. For me to say \u2018thief,\u2019 and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist remark. He\u2019s never taken a game from a man because they said \u2018thief.'\u201d\n\nAfter the match, Williams pointed up to Ramos and said, again, \u201cYou owe me an apology.\u201d Osaka sat and cried as the crowd booed while Ramos came down from his chair.\n\nTen minutes later, the trophy presentation. More crowd boos. Osaka pulled her black visor down as tears continued to stream. Williams put her right arm around Osaka and her left hand on Osaka\u2019s elbow. She said a few words to Osaka as the 20-year-old wiped away a tear. Osaka smiled.\n\n\u201cI felt at one point bad because I\u2019m crying and she\u2019s crying,\u201d Williams said in the later press conference. \u201cYou know, she just won. I\u2019m not sure if they were happy tears or they were just sad tears because of the moment. I felt like, wow, this isn\u2019t how I felt when I won my first Grand Slam [in 1999]. I was like, wow, I definitely don\u2019t want her to feel like that.\n\n\u201cYeah, maybe it was the mom in me that was like, listen, we got to pull ourselves together here.\u201d\n\nSerena comforted an emotional Naomi Osaka after losing in the US Open \ud83d\ude25 pic.twitter.com/oCLTRn66cW \u2014 espnW (@espnW) September 8, 2018\n\nWilliams was the first to speak to the crowd.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, but I don\u2019t want to do questions,\u201d she said when asked to put the match in perspective. \u201cI just want to tell you guys, she played well, and this is her first Grand Slam. \u2026 (crowd applause) \u2026 And I know you guys were here rooting, and I was rooting, too. But let\u2019s make this the best moment we can, and we\u2019ll get through it. Let\u2019s give everyone the credit where credit\u2019s due. Let\u2019s not boo anymore. We\u2019re going to get through this, and let\u2019s be positive. So congratulations, Naomi. No more booing.\n\n\u201cI hope to continue to go and play here again. We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s been a tough year for me.\u201d\n\nThen Osaka was asked how the match compared to her dreams of playing Williams in a Grand Slam final.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sort of defer from your question, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that everyone was cheering for her, and I\u2019m sorry it had to end like this. I just want to say thank you for watching the match.\u201d\n\nIt ended a stressful stretch that began Friday night.\n\n\u201cI just kept thinking about my match,\u201d Osaka said later.\n\nShe tried to get her mind off it. Minutes before the match, she approached Novak Djokovic, who plays in Sunday\u2019s final against Juan Martin del Potro.\n\nShe tried to say hello in Serbian to Djokovic, as she has learned a bit of the language from her coach, former Williams hitting partner Sascha Bajin. She didn\u2019t think Djokovic understood what she said.\n\nThen Osaka, immediately before taking the court for the biggest match of her life, her first Grand Slam final, told national TV that she was nervous.\n\nYet she dominated the first set, converting both of her break points and closing it out with a 117 mile-per-hour serve into Williams\u2019 body.

Ships start plying a less-icy Arctic, thanks to climate change", "text": "\n\n\n\nUnder partly sunny skies and relatively balmy temperatures in the low 50s, the Venta Maersk sailed through the Bering Strait this past week and steered hard to port, beginning a modern-day voyage of discovery that could hearken a transformation for global shipping and the Arctic environment.\n\nThe Venta is a big, new, pricey, ice-class vessel owned by Danish shipping giant Maersk \u2014 and it is the world\u2019s first container ship to attempt the Northern Sea Route, the fabled Northeast Passage that runs from the edge of Alaska to the top of Scandinavia along Russia\u2019s desolate Siberian coastline.\n\nMaritime transit is now possible between July and October because of the rapid and, to many, deeply unsettling retreat of Arctic sea ice due to profound climate change, a trend that is amplified at the North and South poles.\n\nRussia, China and commercial shipping interests are among those with high hopes that the Northern Sea Route could become a melt-season alternative to Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, trim weeks off transit times and slash fuel costs for vessels shuttling between ports in Europe and Asia \u2014 and the Americas.\n\nThe Russian company Rosatom, which runs the largest nuclear-powered ice-breaking fleet in the world, boasts that the route has \u201cno queues and no pirates,\u201d an allusion to the threat posed by African buccaneers in the Gulf of Aden in recent years.\n\nBut as the pace of Arctic traffic quickens, an environment that is today mostly pristine and sparsely populated \u2014 by whales and walruses, scientists and indigenous people, ice-breaking crews and oil workers \u2014 could be transformed.\n\nAnd Russia and its competitors may find themselves at odds over who controls what and where. \u201cThe Arctic has turned into an object of territorial, resource and military-strategic interest for a number of states,\u201d Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu warned last month. \u201cThis could lead to growth in the potential for conflict in this region.\u201d\n\nDecades ago, the polar cap was a Cold War chessboard for dueling navies and submarine war games. The next fight will be more mercantile.\n\nTime-lapse satellite images show sea ice swirling in clockwise gyre around the North Pole, spreading in the winter and shrinking in the summer, year after year. It is plainly discernible that the extent of summer ice has been shrinking \u2014 by 13.4 percent a decade, according to NASA.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward in time, Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, said climate models suggest ice-free summers in the Arctic sometime between 2050 and 2070, with some scenarios forecasting more rapid change, as soon as 2030.\n\nWhat would that look like from a satellite?\n\n\u201cA blue ocean over the North Pole in September,\u201d Meier said.\n\nThat\u2019s extremely distressing for the many who worry about the future of life on this planet. But this \u201cnew Arctic\u201d could be a boon for some, starting with Russia.\n\nThe Northern Sea Route, because of its location along the shallow seas of Siberia, is free of ice earlier and stays free longer than other areas of the Arctic. Much of the route passes through waters along Russia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, and vessels seeking passage must apply for permits and permissions from Russia\u2019s Northern Sea Route Administration. The Russians also charge fees for navigation and ice-breaking assistance.\n\nIt can be a perilous passage.\n\n\u201cIf you get into trouble, you are very far from civilization,\u201d said Mika Hovilainen, a senior project manager at Aker Arctic Technology, which designs ships with hardened propulsion systems and thick bows to withstand the battering of floating sea ice.\n\nHe called conditions in the Arctic, even in summer, \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\nBut the route\u2019s key selling point is time. A ship sailing from South Korea to Germany via South Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope would take on average 46 days, according to searoutes.com. The same voyage via the Suez Canal would be 34 days. The trip via the Northern Sea Route: 23 days.\n\nHundreds of smaller ships are already out there. A few clicks on marinetraffic.com show oil tankers, cargo ships, research vessels. Even a few cruise ships are plying the waters this summer. The Chinese shipping company Cosco is on track to complete a dozen transits this year in freighters.\n\nIt is maritime container traffic, though, along with fossil-fuel tankers, that are the heart and lungs of the global economy. And this is a big moment for both in the Arctic.\n\nRussia shipped the first load of liquefied natural gas from its new, $27 billion Yamal production facility above the Arctic Circle to China\u2019s port of Rudong in July, completing the inaugural trip in 19 days at sea \u2014 16 fewer days than via the Suez Canal. Gas shipments from Yamal to Europe became routine earlier this year.\n\nThe next test is how a modern ice-class, 3,600-container ship such as the Venta Maersk fares.\n\n\n\nFrom a high vista, a man watches as Venta Maersk is loaded with frozen fish at the port in Vladivostok, Russia. (Yuri Maltsev/Reuters)\n\nIn its historic first transit of the Northern Sea Route, the Venta is carrying a cargo of electronics put aboard at Busan in South Korea and frozen fish loaded at the Russian port of Vladivostok. The vessel is scheduled to stop at Bremerhaven, Germany, then terminate in Russia at St. Petersburg in late September.\n\nThe shipping line stresses that this is a \u201cone-off sea trial,\u201d an exploratory voyage to look and learn and gather scientific data, Maersk spokesperson Janina von Spalding said.\n\nThere are Russian pilots aboard to help navigate past the hazards of floating ice. First-year ice is usually two or three feet thick, but in some years, driven by wind and current, young and old ice piles up alongside the Russian islands in ridges 14-feet high.\n\nFour Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers are ready to assist the Venta if needed. They\u2019re routinely deployed to smash through the ice and lead convoys of ships in the fall, winter and spring months.\n\nMalte Humpert, founder of the Arctic Institute, who tracks marine traffic at the pole, cautioned that the environment remains unpredictable.\n\n\u201cThe lifeblood of container shipping is timing. You book a spot at a port terminal hour by hour,\u201d he said, part of the global economy\u2019s \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery systems.\n\n\u201cIn the Arctic, you can\u2019t set your watch by your transit,\u201d Humpert said, because stuff happens.\n\nA few weeks ago, a passenger ship in the Canadian Arctic ran aground, and its passengers had to be evacuated. In late June, ice still choked Russia\u2019s Gulf of Ob, paralyzing shipping, according to the Barents Observer.\n\nThe additional melting expected in the coming years won\u2019t necessarily help, said Andrey Todorov, an expert in Arctic issues at the Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow.\n\n\u201cEven if the ice continues to recede, it doesn\u2019t mean that conditions will become easier for commercial vessels. There will be an even higher risk that huge floating pieces of ice could break from the pack ice and collide,\u201d he said. \u201cReinforcing vessels for ice conditions costs a lot.\n\n\n\nThe hull of the Venta Maersk is reinforced for Arctic conditions. (Yuri Maltsev/Reuters)\n\nThere are concerns beyond the dangers to vessels and their contents.\n\nLand and sea animals may be exposed to new threats, not only by increased shipping, but by the oil, gas and mineral extraction along the Siberian coastline, which harbors a trove of untapped reserves.\n\nEnvironmentalists are not so worried about a ship running down a polar bear, but they are fearful of possible spills as tankers laden with oil and gas operate in extreme conditions, especially in winter. Cold-water spills, one of which involved the Exxon Valdez in Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound in 1989, take decades to clean and disperse.\n\nIn addition to the development of ports, the use of heavy fuels and increased pollution cause concern \u2014 especially the \u201cblack carbon\u201d emitted by ships and industry. The sooty pollution, when spread across the ice, speeds its melting, as dark surfaces absorb rather than reflect the sun\u2019s heat.\n\nGeopolitics could also get a bit messy in the Arctic.\n\nBefore the big melt began, the region was mostly of interest to explorers, scientists, local populations and cold warriors. Now it is seen as an oil field and waterway, with Russia, Denmark, Canada, Norway and the United States asserting rights \u2014 and other countries, such as China, jostling to fish, drill and traverse. Whether the region becomes a \u201cglobal commons\u201d or a flash point is to be seen.\n\nIn testimony this spring before the Senate, the Navy\u2019s U.S. Pacific Command chief, Adm. Harry Harris \u2014 now retired and serving as U.S. ambassador to South Korea \u2014 said: \u201cOf particular note are Russian efforts to build presence and influence in the High North. Russia has more bases north of the Arctic Circle than all other countries combined, and is building more with distinctly military capabilities.\u201d\n\nLaurence C. Smith, a professor of geography at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has modeled future maritime traffic scenarios in the Arctic, said the Northern Sea Route, in the short-term, may be a niche market.\n\nBut he wonders: \u201cImagine a time in the not-so-distant future when ice ceases to be the limiting factor.\u201d\n\nFerris-Rotman reported from Moscow.\n\nRead more\n\nFrench environment minister quits with criticism of Macron\n\n\u2018Scallop Wars\u2019: French and British fishermen clash in the English Channel\n\nA huge stretch of the Arctic Ocean is rapidly turning into the Atlantic.

But he is also backed by some segments of Moscow\u2019s liberal intelligentsia, who, at the same time, voice disdain for Putin\u2019s nationalism and authoritarian rule.\n\nSupporters of the mayor frame it as a kind of grudging pragmatism. Things could be far worse, they say.

It was this segment of the population that turned out for mass anti-Kremlin protests in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe strategy, for now, seems to be working.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ready to accept the fact that they\u2019re crushing the opposition and that there are no elections,\u201d Carnegie expert Kolesnikov said. \u201cThe main thing is that he is modernizing the city. . . . It\u2019s a deal with the devil.\u201d\n\nOleg Shapiro, a star Moscow architect who helped design many of the marquee urban-\n\nimprovement projects, said he chose not to cast a vote when Putin was reelected in March.\n\nHe acknowledged that while Moscow\u2019s cityscape is becoming more Western, Russia\u2019s political system is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nStill, Shapiro joined Sobyanin\u2019s campaign as an official surrogate. He said that rather than pacify the public, his projects might help inspire people to seek more freedom.\n\n\u201cThere are many rather radical people who say, \u2018Listen, you\u2019re distracting people from the real problems,\u2019 \u201d Shapiro said in an interview in his firm\u2019s airy office in a cluster of boutiques, co-work spaces and design studios called Artplay. \u201cWell in that case, so that things get worse for the authorities, why don\u2019t we just all lie down and slit each other\u2019s throats?\u201d\n\n[Opinion: How Brexit is a win for Putin]\n\nSobyanin hired progressive architects such as Shapiro as well as Western consulting firms including McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group. He got rid of billboards and underpass kiosks and introduced new \u00adbus-and-taxi lanes and bike-sharing, scooter-sharing and car-sharing programs.\n\nSpeaking at the Moscow Urban Forum in July, Putin said Sobyanin was \u201crestoring the coziness of Moscow streets\u201d and pledged similar improvements in other Russian cities.\n\nSobyanin, originally from Siberia, is a prototype for the kind of loyal, low-key technocrat that Putin is increasingly installing across Russia\u2019s more than 80 regional governments.\n\nSobyanin\u2019s predecessor as Moscow mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, ran the capital for 18 years as a personal fiefdom and drew residents\u2019 ire for everything from alleged corruption to the 300-foot-tall statue of Peter the Great along the Moscow River.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, then Russia\u2019s president, tapped Sobyanin to replace Luzhkov in 2010. Three years later, Sobyanin faced activist Navalny in the mayoral election. Navalny finished with a stunning 27 percent of the vote \u2014 a sign that anti-Kremlin feelings were widespread in the Russian capital.\n\nMuch of Moscow\u2019s liberal elite had joined Navalny\u2019s campaign. Some, like avant-garde theater director Konstantin Bogomolov, are now on Sobyanin\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cWe want a better future,\u201d Bogomolov said in an Instagram post announcing his decision. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on his switch.

We listen to anyone who wants to talk to us.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, both publicly and privately, has raised the possibility of U.S. military action in Venezuela, although aides have repeatedly dissuaded him, according to a number of officials and people familiar with the episodes, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss foreign policy and intelligence matters.\n\nMaduro has frequently accused the United States of plotting with his opponents, and of economic and actual warfare against him.\n\nThe outreach by the officers \u201chighlighted the level of desperation\u201d in Venezuela, and the Trump administration was eager to understand what was going on inside the armed forces, according to another person familiar with meetings.\n\nBut \u201cwe had very little confidence in the ability of these people to do anything, no idea at all about who they represented, and to what extent they had not exposed themselves already,\u201d the person said.\n\nThe Venezuelan government did not publicly respond to a report about such meetings, which first appeared Saturday in the New York Times. A spokesman said that Maduro or other officials would comment \u201cat the right moment, if they consider it necessary.\u201d\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement that \u201cthe United States government hears daily the concerns of Venezuelans from all walks of life \u2014 be they members of the ruling party, the security services, elements of civil society or from among the millions of citizens forced by the regime to flee abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. policy preference for a peaceful, orderly return to democracy in Venezuela remains unchanged,\u201d the statement said.\n\nVenezuela is in the midst of hyperinflation and severe humanitarian and political crises that have sent millions fleeing to other countries in the hemisphere. In a televised address early this year, Maduro appealed to Pope Francis \u201cto prevent Trump from sending his troops to invade Venezuela.\u201d\n\nTrump has denounced Maduro, who took over in 2013 following the death of revolutionary leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, as a \u201cdictator.\u201d Maduro has twice been elected president since then in votes widely seen as fraudulent, and has gradually taken over virtually all legislative and judicial power and jailed numerous political opponents.\n\nIn August 2017, Trump told reporters that \u201cwe have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.\u201d\n\nJust before those comments, he had raised the issue privately with senior advisers, asking then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just invade? We\u2019ve done it in other parts of the world,\u201d according to current and former officials who said that McMaster recommended \u201cother approaches.\u201d\n\nTrump also raised the possibility of an invasion with Latin American leaders at last year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly, despite efforts by McMaster and others to steer him away from the subject.\n\n[Book, op-ed show how some Trump aides work to curb his instincts]\n\nThe administration has imposed sanctions on a number of Venezuelan officials, including senior military officers. Officials have long said further measures are under consideration, including an embargo on Venezuelan oil. Despite sharply falling oil exports in recent years, Venezuela is the fourth-largest foreign supplier to the United States, which remains the largest purchaser of Venezuelan crude. China and Russia have extended huge loans to prop up the government.\n\nWhile some administration officials and outside advisers have pushed for more muscular U.S. involvement against Maduro, many have expressed dismay at the political opposition\u2019s failure to mobilize a coordinated resistance, and at what appears to be fairly solid support for him within the military.\n\nAdam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America, said few U.S. administrations would pass up the opportunity to meet with alleged coup plotters at least once, given the opacity of the Venezuelan military.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to glean an understanding of a part of Venezuelan society, the military, that none of us knows very much about,\u201d although the decision to meet several times posed a risk of becoming exposed and sparking a backlash in the hemisphere, he said.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to support a military coup in Latin America. They always end badly, but it\u2019s worth listening to these people,\u201d Isacson said. \u201cWhat is their level of discontent? Do they have broad-based support among the population or are they just a bunch of renegades? Do they have an honest plan to start elections? The military is a black box.\u201d\n\nA majority of Latin American governments have denounced Maduro, as has the secretary general of the Organization of American States. But all are aware of the unpopular history of U.S. military intervention in the hemisphere, and there is little appetite for a repeat.\n\nAnalysts in Caracas were unsurprised by the lack of official reaction there to the reports.\n\n\u201cIf they talk about it, they\u2019ll do it in the middle of talking about something else,\u201d said Felix Seijas, political analyst and director of polling agency Delphos.
